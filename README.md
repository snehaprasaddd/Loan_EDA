## Description:
This case study focuses on analyzing customer data from L&T Financial Services to assess creditworthiness and improve loan disbursal strategies. The primary goals are to perform data preprocessing, exploratory and descriptive analysis, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights to reduce Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and enhance profitability.
Understanding the financial services domain is crucial. Key aspects include:
    Asset and Liability Management: Managing investments and obligations over time, considering risks.
    Credit Assessment: Evaluating a customer's ability to repay loans to minimize risks like NPAs.
    Customer Profiling: Analyzing demographics, credit history, income, etc., to make informed lending decisions.
## Checkpoints:
#### a. Data Assessment and Preprocessing
Evaluate Available Data: Understand the dataset's structure, types of variables, and relevance.
Handle Missing Values: Identify and address gaps in the data using imputation or removal techniques.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert non-numeric categories into numerical formats using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might better capture the underlying patterns (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).
### b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identify Patterns and Trends: Look for recurring themes or behaviors in the data.
Analyze Relationships: Examine how different variables interact, such as income vs. loan default rates.
Key Factors to Explore: CIBIL score, payment history, credit history, geographical location, profession, income, age, education.
### c. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
Visualizations: Create charts (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to represent data visually.
Statistical Tests: Perform tests (e.g., Chi-square, t-tests) to determine significant differences or associations.
### d. Credit Risk Assessment
Evaluate Creditworthiness: Use demographic information, credit scores, payment and credit history to assess the likelihood of loan repayment.
Risk Factors: Identify which factors most significantly impact credit risk.
### e. Predictive Modeling
Build Models: Develop machine learning models to predict loan defaults.
Algorithms to Consider: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that contribute most to the prediction.
### f. Evaluation and Recommendations
Assess Model Performance: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Insights on Credit Risk: Highlight key factors influencing creditworthiness.
Recommendations: Suggest strategies to improve credit assessment and loan disbursal, such as refining the scoring model or targeting specific customer segments.
